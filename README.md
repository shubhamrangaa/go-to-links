# GO-TO LINKS CHROME EXTENSION

This is the first version of a chrome extension I'm building. The aim is to build an extension which houses all my profile links in one place.

## Usecase

Recently, I've been applying to a lot of internships and for application that I fill, I'm asked for my profile links be it GitHub or LinkedIn. Currently I access all my links from my own portfolio website. But, while filling multiple applications, this can get tedious.
